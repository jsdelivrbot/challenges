# The Dirty Barrel

### Definition :

Your colleague Ms. Vicky wrote a piece of code that looks pretty weird. Because you're a nice teammate, you want to help her to get a better undestanding of javascript. You decided to take a stab at her dirty piece of code and suggest a cleaner & faster solution.

### The challenge:

Refactor or rewrite the [barrel.js](https://github.com/mentum/challenges/blob/master/dirty-barrel/barrel.js) file in order to make it clear and as bullet proof as it can be. 

### Notes:

* There might be some dead code
* You can use any library you might find usefull
* You can write your solution as es5, es6 or es7
* If you run the code, it will not work! Don't panic, it's normal.

### Submission:
Open a pull request to this repository with your solution named this way under the right problem's folder:

Happy coding !
