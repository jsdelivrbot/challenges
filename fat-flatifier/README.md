# Fat Flatifier

### Definition :

Ivan wants to know how many "FatFlats" are on the sidewalks of Madrid but he can't count them all by himself. Help him by implementing the FatFlatifier. The fatflatifier is a helper function that takes 2 integers as inputs N and K and returns an array of strings. Each word in the array is or "Fat" or "Flat". From now on, let FF be that returned array.

##### constraints
* N is the total number of words in FF
* K is the number of couples ( i, j ) where ```FF[i] == "Fat"``` and ```FF[j] == "Flat"```
* ```0 < i < j <= N```

### The challenge:
Implement the FatFlatifier in the language of your choice. You can either create a class FlatFlatifier that contains the fatflatify and a verify function or a simple FatFlatifier as a helper function for Ivan.
Write the solution in a clear and readable code. If you have an optimal solution, way to go! If not, no worries! You get some extra points if you add some fantasy!
