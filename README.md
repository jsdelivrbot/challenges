#### Side note
Some of the problems defined here are directly taken from [topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com). As we wanted to compare our solutions as a team and be able to discuss them after having solved them, we weren't able to use the topcoder platform.

#### Submissions:
Open a pull request to this repository with your solution in a folder named this way under the right problem's folder:
